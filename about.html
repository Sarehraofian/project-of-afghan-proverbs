      <h3>History Of Afghan Proverbs</h3>
      <p>
        The blood feuds, treachery and violence usually associated with the
        jagged borderlands of Afghanistan are a surprising landscape in which to
        discover cultural gems that reflect the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The
        premise of this paper is that embedded within Muslim cultures -
        specifically, within the ‘folk’ literature and ‘lore’ of Muslim ethnic
        groups, there are significant resources for contextualizing and telling
        the story of the Cross, and for peace-making, inter-faith dialogue and
        reconciliation. These folk notions, narrative themes, oral forms, and
        localized traditions can provide conceptual, theological, cultural and
        aesthetic bridges to the hearts and minds of Muslim peoples, and an
        indigenous mechanism to contest more militant, chauvinistic and
        hegemonic religious understandings that may promote conflict. Some
        approaches to Christian-Muslim relations foreground notions associated
        with religious and communal identity and inter-faith polemics.
        Inter-religious dialogue tends to involve, by definition, religious
        discourse and an implicit or explicit marking of communal boundaries.
        Conversations on faith issues are generally not only communal but
        textual, deriving from and based upon the authority of scriptures and
        written interpretative traditions. Yet, however globalised our faith
        discourse, inevitably authentic dialogue between believers and faith
        communities must be actualized in local dialogue in specific contexts,
        in relationships and faith conversations between a Self and Others in
        which the unique nuances of local language, identity and custom can be
        appreciated and affirmed, and the meaning of Jesus in that context can
        be explored. Folklore is related to the worldview of a culture, and as
        Kraft affirms, one would look to fables, proverbs, riddles, songs, and
        other forms of folklore for overt and covert indications of the
        worldview. A folkloristic approach to Muslim cultures can help us
        understand the dynamics of local meaning systems and their expressions
        in and through oral literature and other traditional forms.A proverb is
        a short sentence that people often quote, which gives advice or tells
        you something about life. Proverbs provide a window into the minds and
        hearts of Afghans; and these proverbs have been carefully selected from
        among the many thousands in use in Afghanistan by Dr. J. Christy Wilson,
        Jr., a Christian educator and humanitarian who served in Kabul for over
        twenty years. The current revised edition of One Hundred Afghan Persian
        Proverbs includes a transliteration of each proverb based on the
        phonetic system devised by Eugene Glassman, thereby facilitating the use
        of the book as a language and culture acquisition resource, and a
        companion volume to the book Conversational Dari. This proverb book will
        be of special interest to teachers and students of Dari (Afghan
        Persian), relief and development workers and NGOs assisting the Afghan
        people, and to the large English-speaking Afghan Diaspora in the West,
        who desire to share the treasures of their culture with their own
        children and friends.
